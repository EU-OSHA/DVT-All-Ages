        <h2>Introduction to the project</h2>

        <p>The European Commission concluded a delegation agreement with the European Agency for Safety and Health at Work (EU-OSHA) to carry out a pilot project entitled ‘Safer and healthier work at any age — occupational safety and health (OSH) in the context of an ageing workforce’.</p>

        <p>This was based on a decision and request of the European Parliament, whose objective was to further investigate possible ways of improving the safety and health of older people at work, as the ageing of the workforce will have a serious financial impact on workers, employers and taxpayers.</p>

        <p>Thus, the project aimed to assess the prerequisites for OSH strategies and systems to take account of an ageing workforce and improve risk prevention and health protection for all throughout working life.</p>
        <p>The project:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>reviewed current knowledge in relation to OSH, ageing, and older workers;</li>
            <li>investigated EU and Member States’ policies and strategies addressing the challenges of an ageing workforce, in particular in relation to OSH;</li>
            <li>investigated EU and Member States’ policies and systems in relation to rehabilitation and return to work;</li>
            <li>gathered examples of successful and innovative practices in workplaces.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Within the project, existing data and information were reviewed through desk research, including by national experts, and discussion groups in selected countries. The information obtained was summarised in various <a class="external" target="_blank" href="https://osha.europa.eu/es/themes/osh-management-context-ageing-workforce/ep-osh-project">reports</a>, including 31 country-specific reports, analyses of policies addressing the ageing of the workforce in the field of OSH, employment, public health and education, as well as rehabilitation and return-to-work systems and programmes.</p>

        <p>This data visualisation tool presents the key findings of the project and allows users to explore the data in an interactive way by comparing countries and searching for policies, strategies and programmes, among other possibilities.</p>

        <p>Data sources used in the project included harmonised data at the European level to ensure comparability, such as:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>

                <ul>
                    <li>The EU LFS is a large household sample survey providing quarterly results on the labour participation of people aged 15 years and over, as well as on persons outside the labour force. The data collection covers 1983 onwards. In general, data for individual countries are available, depending on their accession date.</li>
                    <li>EU LFS ad hoc modules — since 1999, the so called ‘ad hoc modules’ have been an inherent part of the EU LFS. The aim of the ad hoc modules is to provide users with data on a specific topic concerning the labour market. The following ad hoc modules were used in the project:
                        <ul>
                            <li>2013 — accidents at work and other work-related health problems;</li>
                            <li>2012 — transition from work into retirement.</li>
